### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

#### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow
- NPM

### What I learned

In this project, I was able to practice my JavaScript skills by creating an interactive rating component. I gained practical experience in working with event listeners and managing states in JavaScript. Through this challenge, I was able to apply my knowledge of JavaScript to build real-world applications. Overall, this project helped me improve my front-end development skills, specifically in JavaScript.
